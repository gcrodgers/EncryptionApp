# EncryptionApp

Personal project to familiarize myself more with encryptions and refresh my GUI knowledge.

Creates a GUI using JavaFX that implements simple demonstrations of the following cryptography algorithms:
-Caesar Cipher
-RSA
-Triple DES CBC
-AES CBC

TODO: Current implementation for all but Caesar Cipher uses java.security and javax.crypto. While this has taught me how these algorithms work, I would like to try implementations without them if possible.

TODO: Improve the look of GUI (using CSS).

Possible future additions: login, encrypt/decrypt whole files, Blowfish/Twofish?
